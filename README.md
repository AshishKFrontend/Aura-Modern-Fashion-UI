## 🌪️ About The Project

**AURA** is not just a landing page; it's an exploration of modern web interactivity. Designed to replicate the feel of high-end fashion editorials, this project leverages heavy DOM manipulation and physics-based scrolling to create an immersive user journey.

The goal was to move away from static layouts and build an experience where every scroll, hover, and click feels "alive."

### 🎨 Key Features

* **⚡ Physics-Based Scrolling:** Integrated **Lenis** for a silky smooth, inertia-based scroll experience that mimics mobile apps.
* **🎭 Theatrical Reveals:** Complex entrance animations using **GSAP Timeline**, featuring text masking and image clip-path expansions.
* **🧲 Magnetic UI:** Custom cursor logic and magnetic buttons in the footer that snap to the user's mouse.
* **🛍️ 3D Interactions:** Product cards featuring tilt effects and depth perception on hover.
* **📱 Adaptive Layouts:** A fully responsive design with a custom-built mobile navigation overlay and unique polygon-clipped navbar.
